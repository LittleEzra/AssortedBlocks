Added:
- Teardrop Grass Block
- Tall Teardrop Grass
    - Made by bonemealing Short Teardrop Grass
- Ancient Tear
    - Now dug up by Sniffers instead of Teardrop Grass directly
    - Can be applied onto a Dirt block to make a Teardrop Grass block
- Sniffer Cake
    - Can be fed to Sniffers to make them dig sooner
Changes:
- Made Teardrop Grass flammable (30 spread speed, 60 flammability), being slightly less so than Short Grass
- Renamed Teardrop Grass to Short Teardrop Grass (this _might_ result in all currently existing Teardrop Grass disappearing)
Fixes:
- Made Short Teardrop Grass (and Tall Teardrop) Grass compostable
- Made Sniffers no longer occasionally not dig up an item
- Added a Rocky Dirt recipe
Technical:
- Updated to NeoForge 21.1.200
- Moved the additional Sniffer loot to a data map instead
