Artistry adds generally minor features in the form of blocks that complement the base game, ranging from extensions to pre-existing block palettes to entirely new block sets!

And don't worry - the mod doesn't alter world generation at all, so it can be added at any point in a playthrough.
## Features
### Aspen Trees
Aspen Saplings can be crafted by surrounding any sapling with eight gold nuggets. They can then be grown and propagated just like any other sapling.
Aspen Trees are similar to Birch, though their leaves are a vibrant yellow color.
### Mossy and Cracked Bricks
Crafted just like Mossy and Cracked Stone Bricks, these blocks help to add more variation to brick walls.
### Tables
Tables are a simple piece of furniture made out of stone or any wood type.
Blooming Vines and Sunsprouts

These are two new plants added to what the Sniffer can dig up. Blooming Vines can be spread similar to Glow Lichen, while Sunsprouts grow into Sunburst Vines, which can be bonemealed to get more.
