<p>A mod to add some blocks I thought might be useful</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Artistry adds generally minor features in the form of blocks that complement the base game,
ranging from extensions to pre-existing block palettes to entirely new block sets!

And don't worry - the mod doesn't alter world generation at all, so it can be added at any point in a playthrough.
